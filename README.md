This is the first project created from the Odin project .

It demonstrates HTML including Hypertext links (\<a href="link-target"\>link text\</a\>), unordered lists (\<ul\>\</ul\>), ordered lists (\<ol\>\</OL\>), items in lists (\<li\>\</li\>), images (\<img src="link to image"\>), headings (\<h1\>\</h1\>), good file management (appropriate directories, etc.).
