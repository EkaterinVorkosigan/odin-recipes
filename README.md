# odin-recipes
Odin Recipes first project

This is the first project created from the Odin project .

It demonstrates HTML including Hypertext links (\<a href="link-target"\>link text\</a\>), unordered lists (\<ul\>\</ul\>), ordered lists (\<ol\>\</ol\>), items in lists (\<li\>\</li\>), images (\<img src="link to image"\>), headings (\<h1\>\</h1\>), and good file management (appropriate directories, etc.).

It also demonstrates git and GitHub skills such as creating repos, regular and appropriate commits with good commit messages, and pushing the commits up to GitHub also as appropriate.
